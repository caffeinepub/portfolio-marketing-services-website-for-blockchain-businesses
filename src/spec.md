# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update and expand the “Signature Transformative Work” cards to use the correct URLs with automatic link previews, and add a new Fancy Studios card.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the “ROLLAPPS ON SOLANA — EthCC” card to use https://luma.com/jl85cn4t for both its link and LinkPreview, and ensure its Open action opens in a new tab.
- Update the “COINTELEGRAPH — Opinion Contributor” card to use https://cointelegraph.com/authors/shailey-singh for both its link and LinkPreview, and ensure its Open action opens in a new tab.
- Add a new card adjacent to the Cointelegraph card titled “FANCY STUDIOS — Gaming Creativity” with italic subtitle “Blockchain gaming”, the provided description text, and https://fancy-studios.gitbook.io/whitepaper for both its link and LinkPreview, with Open in a new tab.

**User-visible outcome:** In the “Signature Transformative Work” section, users see updated link previews and can open the Rollapps, Cointelegraph, and new Fancy Studios links in new tabs, with the Fancy Studios card appearing next to the Cointelegraph card in the grid.
