# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revert the Shailey Portfolio application from Draft Version 13 back to Draft Version 10, removing all changes introduced in drafts 11–13.

**Planned changes:**
- Restore the codebase and deployed app UI/behavior to match App draft Version 10 exactly.
- Undo/restore any image/media changes made in drafts 11–13 so site visuals match Draft Version 10, including:
  - The Selected Signals “AVAIL — The Nexus Effect” card media appearance/behavior.
  - The Hero section background asset/reference.
- Ensure the reverted build passes any existing automated builds/tests.

**User-visible outcome:** The live site looks and behaves exactly as it did in Draft Version 10, with the Hero background and the “AVAIL — The Nexus Effect” card media restored to their Draft Version 10 behavior and no remaining changes from drafts 11–13.
