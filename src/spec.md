# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Align the app’s Selects and Experience sections with Aurient.ai’s styling, category label format, and image click behavior while keeping existing Tailwind theme tokens.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Selects section typography, spacing, card/grid layout, and hover interactions to more closely match Aurient.ai’s Selects section (within existing theme tokens).
- Update Experience section typography, spacing, timeline/card layout, and hover interactions to more closely match Aurient.ai’s Experience section (within existing theme tokens).
- Replace displayed category labeling in Selects and Experience with concise uppercase labels: AI, ART, TECH, CRYPTO, CULTURE (and remove longer category strings from the label position).
- Add/replace Selects and Experience item images to match those shown on Aurient.ai, and make each image open in a new tab with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

**User-visible outcome:** Selects and Experience look and behave more like Aurient.ai, show concise uppercase category labels, and display matching images that open in a new browser tab when clicked.
