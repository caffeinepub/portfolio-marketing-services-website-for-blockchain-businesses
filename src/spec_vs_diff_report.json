  "summary": "REQ-1/REQ-2 appear implemented via new SectionHeader component and updated Selects/Experience section layouts, card styling, and hover behaviors using existing Tailwind tokens. REQ-3 is implemented by rendering concise uppercase category labels via `displayCategory` fields. REQ-4 is partially implemented: images are wired into content and rendered as clickable links opening in a new tab with `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"`, but the diff summary does not show the actual image assets being added, so reliable production rendering and exact image matching cannot be verified.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Add the same images shown in Aurient.ai’s Selects and Experience sections to the corresponding items in this app, and ensure all images render reliably in production builds (no broken images).",
      "reason": "The content now references image paths under `/assets/aurient/...`, and UI renders them, but the diff summary does not include any added image files (e.g., in `frontend/public/assets/...` or similar). Without the actual assets present, the 'same images' and 'no broken images in production builds' acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed from the diff.",
