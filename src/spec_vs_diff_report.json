  "summary": "The diff does not demonstrate a full revert to Draft Version 10. It mainly updates the Selected Signals section to embed an X/Twitter post via a new/modified XPostEmbed component, and updates metadata/summaries. Key revert elements (undoing drafts 11–13 across the codebase, and restoring Hero background/media behavior to Draft 10) are not evidenced in the provided file changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Revert the codebase and deployed app from the current state (App draft Version 13) back to the state from three drafts earlier (App draft Version 10), undoing all changes introduced in drafts 11–13.",
      "reason": "Only 4 files are shown modified, and the changes shown add/enable X/Twitter embedding behavior rather than broadly reverting code/UI/behavior. The diff provides no evidence that all drafts 11–13 changes were undone across the codebase, nor that the overall UI/behavior matches Draft 10.",

      "requirement": "Restore the website visuals/content affected by recent image/media changes to match Draft Version 10 (including Selected Signals “AVAIL — The Nexus Effect” card media behavior and the Hero section background asset/reference), with no unintended image swap anywhere.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the AVAIL card now uses an embedded X/Twitter post (XPostEmbed), which is not evidence of restoring Draft 10 media behavior. No actual change to the Hero section file (or its background asset/reference) is present in the modified-files list; the only mention of Hero restoration appears in a generated summary text file, not as code changes to HeroSection itself.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest asks to revert to Draft Version 10 and explicitly lists as a non-goal adding new features or additional media swap logic; the diff implements/uses an X embed feature rather than demonstrating a revert to Draft 10 behavior.",

      "description": "Changing Selected Signals card configuration to include showXEmbed/xPostUrl flags and conditional rendering for X embed vs link preview.",
      "reason": "This is new behavior/configuration visible in the diff and is not requested by the revert requirements; it appears to introduce/maintain post-embed logic rather than revert to prior behavior.",
