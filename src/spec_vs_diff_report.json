  "summary": "REQ-2 is implemented by updating the AVAIL — The Nexus Effect card to render a static image instead of a link preview/embed. REQ-3 is not evidenced because no new static image asset was added under frontend/public/assets. REQ-1 is only partially supported by evidence: HeroSection now points to a hero background image path, but the requirement explicitly called for keeping the same src path in code and restoring the underlying asset content; the diff shows the src path in HeroSection.tsx being modified rather than confirming an asset-content restore.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Hero section still uses the same src path currently referenced in frontend/src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx, with the underlying asset content restored to the original hero background.",
      "reason": "The diff shows HeroSection.tsx being modified to use src=\"/assets/generated/hero-bg.dim_1920x1080.png\". This does not demonstrate that the same pre-existing src path was preserved and that only the underlying asset content was restored.",

      "reason": "No files were added in the diff (\"Added: 0\"), so there is no evidence that the user-provided image was placed under frontend/public/assets/. Although SelectedSignalsSection references /assets/generated/avail-nexus-effect.dim_1600x900.png, the asset addition itself is not shown.",
